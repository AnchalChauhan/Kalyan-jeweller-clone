            <pre>
We are one of the oldest business 
families in India with a family legacy
of over a century in business, starting
from as early as 1908. Started for the
noble cause of nation-building and
self-sustenance in a pre-independent
India, the forefathers believed ethical,
honest and transparent business
practices should form the foundation
       of the group.

    Today, when I look around me, business is all about toplines, bottomlines and market capitalisation. But Kalyan entered into business in a <br>
    pre-independent India to build a better India, as our forefathers believed ethical, fair business will make India self-sufficient and strong.

        Personally, I believe Kalyan Jewellers' major achievement is the trust we have earned from millions of people across the length and <br>
        breadth of a huge subcontinent like India, and abroad in the GCC.
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
        We have always believed in fair and transparent business. We have believed that the customer should be understood so well that we <br>
        know his needs much before he understands them himself. We have believed that an enlightened customer is the best customer. These <br>
        are the simple principles that have helped us reach where we are today.
    </div>
    <div class="box3">
        Today, Kalyan Jewellers has 137 retail stores spread across INDIA and MIDDLE EAST. Pampered by your unbound love and support and <br>
        with the blessings of the Almighty, we believe we are in the right path towards the accomplishment of our vision to open stores and <br>
        serve customers across the world.

            I feel our biggest differentiator is not only the ability to understand local,<br>
            think local and act local, but at the same time bring in our vast experience <br>
            and sourcing strength out of operating in multiple markets. Jewellery is <br>
            a complicated product, because tastes vary even within the same state. What <br>
            helps us here is the huge variety of products we stock from artisans across <br>
            the country and even the Arab countries. We carefully and painstakingly select <br>
            the designs of our products and customise them according to the demands of <br>
            the consumer demography of each market we step into as India is such a vast <br>
            country with diverse. <br> <br>
            We have something for everyone. Highly skilled craftsmen create our products <br>
            along with stringent quality control measures which creates that perfection in <br>
            the products we sell.

            <p>We have always visualized everything on a large scale. We always enjoyed <br>
               making the road and never thought of following a trail. Massive marketing <br>
               campaigns and launches, path-breaking ads which were never-before seen in <br>
               jewellery advertising, multi-storey large format jewellery showrooms, same- <br>
               day multi-launch ceremonies and events. We have always worked with the <br>
               best to endorse our brand at all levels, our brand ambassadors come from <br>
               very respected families in their states, and they are known worldwide among <br>
               their diaspora. We introduced a lot to jewellery retailing - customer loyalty <br>
               programs, price tags, customer service centers, corporate tie-ups and many <br>
               such things. We have always believed in thinking ahead of the customer, in his <br>
               interest, for his interest. <br>
               We have immense gratitude towards everybody who set their feet into a <br>
               Kalyan store and we would always want everyone to continue to be a part of <br>
               this vibrant family at Kalyan and we will do anything and everything for that.
