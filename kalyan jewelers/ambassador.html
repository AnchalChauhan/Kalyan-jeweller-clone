            <h1>KATRINA KAIF</h1> <br>
            <p>Katrina Kaif is one of the most commercially successful actresses in Bollywood today. <br>
               Her debut in ‘Boom’ (2003) put Katrina Kaif in the public eye <br> 
               and launched her on a successful modelling career. She overcame a  <br>
               poor command of Hindi to break into the big time in Bollywood. An <br> 
               appearance in a Telugu film ‘Malliswari’ in 2004 was followed by a series <br> 
               of big budget Hindi films opposite the top rung of Bollywood heroes <br> 
               starting from ‘Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya’ (2005) with Salman Khan <br> 
               and ‘Namastey London’ (2007) with Akshay Kumar. A series of box-office hits <br> 
               followed including ‘Singh is Kinng’, ‘Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani’, ‘Zindagi <br> 
               Na Milegi Dobara’, ‘Meri Brother Ki Dulhan’, ‘Welcome’, ‘Ek Tha Tiger’, <br> 
               ‘Dhoom 3’, ‘Jagga Jasoos’ and many others culminating in the 2017 <br> 
               blockbuster ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’. <br> <br>
               Believing in giving back to society, Katrina works with Relief Projects <br> 
               India, a charitable trust run by her mother which rescues abandoned baby <br> 
               various charity shows to raise funds for various social causes. <br> <br>
               In 2013, Katrina was ranked ninth on Forbes' list of India's best-known <br> 
               entertainers. In 2015, she became the eighth Bollywood actor to have a <br> 
               wax figure installed at Madame Tussauds in London. Katrina has also <br> 
               appeared on Verve's list of most powerful women and the Indian edition <br> 
               of People has described her as "India's Most Beautiful Woman". <br> <br>
               Her performances in ‘New York’ (2009) and ‘Mere Brother Ki Dulhan’ (2011) <br> 
               earned her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She has <br> 
               won numerous awards at the Stardust Awards, Zee Cine Awards, Star Guild <br> 
               Awards, IIFA Awards and the Big Star Entertainment Awards.</p> <br> <br>
